> A Tiny Redis Server with no external dependencies ...

Stockpile is a Tiny Redis Server, created from scratch in Node.js with only few dependencies. It is a work in progress, and is not yet ready for production use. It was initially a part of [CodeCrafter's - Create Redis Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/redis/). But, I decided to make it a standalone project. I will be adding more features to it, and will be using it in my future projects. I will also be adding more tests to it. If you want to contribute, please feel free to do so.
